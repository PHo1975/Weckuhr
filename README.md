Alarm clock with easy delay setting and nag screen

I created that alarm clock for a relative who needed to stand up every 90 mins at night.
The ui allows an easy setting of the alarm delay by having buttons to increase the delay about 1 or 30 mins.
When the alarm appears, you first need to click a button and then on anothe screen you need to trag along a green line in the screen center.
This prohibits accidentally turning off the alarm without standing up.
